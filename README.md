# ✏️ Webcam Sketch Generator using OpenCV

A simple Python project that captures an image from your webcam and converts it into a pencil sketch using OpenCV.

This project demonstrates real-time image capture and basic image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and image blending.


## 🚀 Features

- Capture image using webcam

- Convert captured image into pencil sketch

- Automatically save the sketch as a JPG file

- Display the final sketch output


## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python

- OpenCV


## 📌 How It Works

1. The webcam opens and displays live video.

2. Press SPACE to capture an image.

3. The captured image is converted into:

    - Grayscale

    - Inverted image

    - Blurred image

    - Pencil sketch effect using image division

4. The sketch is saved as:

```
sketch_image.jpg
```

5. The final sketch is displayed on screen.

## ▶ How to Run

1. Install OpenCV:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

2. Run the script:

```
python filename.py
```

## 🎮 Controls

- **SPACE** → Capture Image

- **ESC** → Exit


## 📂 Output

After capturing, the generated sketch will be saved in the same directory as:

```
sketch_image.jpg
```
